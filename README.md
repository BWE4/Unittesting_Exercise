# Unittesting Exercise

## Overview

Welcome to the Unittesting Exercise project! In this project, you are required to write unit tests, run them, and ensure they pass successfully. This exercise will help you develop essential skills in testing and debugging code. The goal is to read through the instructions, fork this repository, and make sure all your tests pass.

## Instructions

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Navigate to the main page of this repository.
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the page. This will create a copy of this repository under your own GitHub account.
3. A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original "upstream" repository.Basically its creating a copy of the repo to your own github. 

### 2. Clone the Forked Repository

1. After forking the repository, clone it to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_FORKED_REPO_NAME.git

###3. Do the exercise:
1.Create a unit test that takes in a list of numbers to the nth term and returns a string of even numbers.
2.Create a unit test that takes in a list of numbers to the nth term and returns a string of odd numbers.

###4.What is expected:
  1.I expect that you should be able to write the unit test and make it pass.I will review your code.
